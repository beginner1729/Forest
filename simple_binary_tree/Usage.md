# Simple Binary Tree

This is a simple binary tree implementation using templates in c++.
I have tried to explain some nuances of c++ templates through this implementation also a brush up of the ideas.
Will soon add a python wrapper for this one

# How to use

This implemenataion is not very user friendly the testing examples simple put the tools of the programs in the display.
Simply run the makefile node_makefile.mk with the command `make -f node_makefile.mk all` and run the `outfile` binary, enjoy.
